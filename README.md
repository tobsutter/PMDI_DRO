# PMDI_DRO
Matlab code for paper ``Robust Generalization despite Distribution Shift via Minimum Discriminating Information"

We provide code for the three examples reported in the paper

1) Synthetic dataset --- covariate shift adaptation ==> see subfolder called "synthetic_data"

2) Real world data --- clasification under sample bias ==> see subfolder called "hearth_disease"

3) OPE for MDPs --- inventory control example ==> see subfolder OPE
